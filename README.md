# Person Information  

In this project is program that manage <i>Persons</i> in different categories, such as:

* Pupil
* Student
* Student - Employee

Here I tried to make output clearer. If you are <b>Mac OS X</b> or <b>Windows</b> user, here can appear some troubles, because what is situated <i>" system ( <u>here</u> ); "</i> is a direct command in CMD. In this case you must study about it, or fix if you know how.

<b>Hint: </b>Write the command that clears your CMD Screen:

<i>system (" <u><b>here</b></u> "); </i>

#### All is working fine. Send ideas <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox?compose=CllgCKCFTJZKgSPbtdMMGmMlzCrXjzBNkncrsntwvHqZnRJpJXkjVfSbBFjJCxTZvCJXKgDRfPg">here</a> that is need to add  in code.

# Patch 1.3:
* Added <i>using namespace <b>std</b></i> and rewritten program.

* Also fixed the infinite bug in swithching, by converting the <i>string</i> to <i>int</i>, but not directly a sensitive <i>int</i>.

* Added aligning in the program for a little more orienting. <a href="https://ibb.co/59Cy5n8">Example here</a>.

# Patch 1.2:
* Removed <i>using namespace <b>std</b></i> and rewritten program.

* Added coloured text for orienting.  
  <b>Warning:</b> It works only in <i>bash</i>, in another words only for Linux and Mac users. Unluck for Windows users ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ.

* Decided not to add multi-threading, because the program isn't so complex yet.

* Tested on <i>KDE Neon 5.18.5</i> - works fine.

### Next patch: 

* Little aligning in the output
* Send ideas <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox?compose=CllgCKCFTJZKgSPbtdMMGmMlzCrXjzBNkncrsntwvHqZnRJpJXkjVfSbBFjJCxTZvCJXKgDRfPg">here</a> (gmail is here).

# Patch 1.1:
* All program was separated in more files:

    * <i>main.cpp</i> - the executable part

    * <i>commands.h</i> - contains only "calls" of functions

    * <i>commands.cpp</i> - contains the functions declared in previous file

    * <i>class_file_1.cpp</i> - contains the class in reference to Person

    * <i>class_file_2.cpp</i> - contains the class in reference to Pupil

    * <i>class_file_3.cpp</i> - contains the class in reference to Student

    * <i>class_file_3.cpp</i> - contains the class in reference to Student - Employee

* Little optimization:

    * Removed constructor from Input_info
