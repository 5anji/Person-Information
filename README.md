# Person Information  

In this project is program that manage <i>Persons</i> in different categories, such as:

* Pupil
* Student
* Student - Employee

Here I tried to make output clearer. If you are <b>Mac OS X</b> or <b>Windows</b> user, here can appear some troubles, because what is situated <i>" system ( <u>here</u> ); "</i> is a direct command in CMD. In this case you must study about it, or fix if you know how.

<b>Hint: </b>Write the command that clears your CMD Screen:

<i>system (" <u><b>here</b></u> "); </i>

#### All is working fine. Send ideas that is need to add.
